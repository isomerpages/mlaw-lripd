</p>
<p><strong>Renewal Period</strong>
</p>
<p>It is an offence if you act, advertise, or hold out as an insolvency practitioner
in relation to a corporation or an individual without a valid insolvency
practitioner’s licence pursuant to section 48 of the Insolvency, Restructuring
and Dissolution Act 2018 ("IRDA").</p>
<p>If your insolvency practitioner’s licence is expiring on 30th June of
the year, and you intend to continue acting or undertake insolvency or
debt restructuring officeholder appointments, you should renew your licence
by submitting your application via <a href="https://dashboard.gobusiness.gov.sg/login" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GoBusiness Dashboard</a> from <strong>1 March to 30 April</strong> of
the year in which the licence expires (“licence’s expiry year”).</p>
<p>If you fail to submit your renewal application before 30 April of the
licence’s expiry year, you will be required to submit your application
as a <strong>new</strong> applicant and be subject to the corresponding prescribed
fee.</p>
<p><strong>Renewal Application Process</strong>
</p>
<p>The renewal application process is the same as the new licence application
process. Please refer to <a href="https://lripd.mlaw.gov.sg/information-for-insolvency-practitioners/licence-application-process/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Licence Application Process</a> for
more information on the process and documents required.</p>
<p><strong>Validity of the Licence</strong>
</p>
<p>A renewed licence will continue to be valid for a further period of 3
years, starting on the date immediately following that on which the licence
would have expired (i.e. 30 June 20XX) if it was not renewed. For example,
if a licence expires on 30 June 2023 and the renewal is granted on 30 April
2023, the renewed licence will commence on 1 July 2023 and expire on 30
June 2026.</p>
